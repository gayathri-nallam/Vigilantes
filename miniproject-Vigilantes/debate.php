<h1><center>DEBATE</center></h1>
<h3>Definition of Debate:</h3>
<p><div>A formal discussion on a particular matter in a public meeting or legislative assembly, in which opposing arguments are put forward and which usually ends with a vote.</div></p>
<h3>What is Debate?</h3>
<p><div>A debate is an organized argument or contest of ideas in which the participants discuss a topic from two opposing sides. Those who agree with this statement or idea are the "Pro" side.  Those who will not agree with this statement or idea are the "Con" side.  Each side will show in an organized and clever way why they believe to have the right answers.  They will use examples and evidence to support their ideas while working towards a conclusion. </div> </p>
<p><div>The aim of a debate is to convince the opposition that you are right. When the two sides agree on the subject or when one side's arguments are more convincing than the other side that is when the debate comes to a close. In a formal debate, a mediator (a person that has not agreed with the Pro or the Con) will decide who the winner should be. In an informal debate the argument can continue until the time when one side gives up . </div> </p>
<h2>How is Debate conducted?</h2>
<h3>1.Introduce the topic:</h3>
<p><div>All debates start with a topic, or resolution. Often, this resolution is a proposed course of action that one team will argue for and another will argue against. Choose a topic to which your students can relate and perhaps one with practical application. You can make the topic less serious or more serious. In any case, be sure that your students understand the issue and any specialized vocabulary that goes with it.</div></p>
<h3>2.Assign the Affirmative and the Negative:</h3>
<p><div>There are two sides to any debate. Naturally, one will argue for and another against the resolution. With ESL students, it is best to group your students into teams to research and argue the issue rather than expecting one student to do all the work. This way one student does not have all the pressure to perform, and the other members of the group can help with comprehension and strategy. Ideally, break your class into four groups (you will want at least three students in each group) and assign two groups to each of two resolutions. Then assign one of each pair of student groups to the affirmative. This group will argue for the issues being presented. The other two groups will be the negative and will argue against the resolutions. During the debate, the other groups will serve as the judges and decide which side presented a stronger case voting for the winners of the debate at its conclusion.</div></p>
<h3>3.Give Time for Research:</h3>
<p><div>Your students will need time to research the issue. Not only that, they will also need additional instruction on the specific vocabulary that may be involved. Make sure all of your students understand any specialized vocabulary so the efficacy of their arguments does not depend on simple comprehension. Encourage each group to form a strategy as to who will do most of the talking during the debate though remind them that all of them are expected to participate in the research and strategy of the debate. Then, during the preparation time in anticipation of the rebuttal, your students should discuss with their teams the points the opposition made and decide how to refute them.</div></p>
<h3>4.Keep Track of Time:</h3>
<p><div>If you are unfamiliar with formal debate, the speakers follow a set order. The following is the most basic of debate structure.
First, the affirmative group receives two minutes to present their case to the audience.
The negative group then receives two minutes to present their case.</div>
<div>After both sides have a chance to speak, both teams receive two minutes to prepare a rebuttal and summary. The order of speech is reversed now and the negative side presents their rebuttal and summary for the first two minutes.
The last to speak is the affirmative team who then presents their rebuttal and summary for two minutes. The debate is now concluded.
There are other structures that you can follow for debate, and they may be useful once your class is familiar with the process and strategy of debate, but if this is the first time your students are formally debating, keeping things simple is best.
</div></p>
<h3>5.Make a Judgment:</h3>
<p><div>Usually in debate, the winner is the one who has presented the strongest case. For ESL classes, the overall purpose of speaking is more important than the specific outcome of the debate. Still, your students will probably want to know who won. To determine the winner, have the audience vote on which team they thought made the most convincing argument. With this, weigh your own opinion as to who communicated clearly and refuted the opponent’s arguments best. This combination will identify your winners.</div></p>
<p><div>Your grading process, on the other hand, does not have to name a winner and a loser. As long as your students were able to communicate clearly, use good grammar, and have good pronunciation, the debate was a success, and their grades should reflect that success.</div></p>
<h3>Why Debate?</h3>
<p><div>&nbsp &nbsp 1.	Debate skills are essential to public life. When the world’s first  universities were established, three skills were considered essential for leadership and promotion of the best ideas: grammar, logic, and rhetoric:what we now know as reading, writing, and speaking. Today in the 21st century, the ability to create, present, and evaluate ideas remains essential to democracy and commerce in modern societies. A debate program fosters these traits.</div>
<div>&nbsp &nbsp2.	Debate programs are transformational experiences for students. In a debate program, students engage voluntarily in a social activity that reaps significant intellectual benefits, and rewards academic skills: quick thinking, sound argument, and confident speaking. There are few college spaces where intellectual and social goals align so well to inform a young citizen. And for those who observe debates, they see citizens reasoning, articulating, listening, responding, and ultimately respecting one another.</div>
<div>&nbsp &nbsp3.	Debate programs create leaders. Leading requires intelligence, vision, empathy, efficiency, and resolve. Participating in and studying debate cultivates these essential leadership skills in young women and men. In a world in which incorrect information and unjustified ideas are abundant, debate creates the sort of confident leaders who can direct public thinking toward moral and prosperous decisions.</div>
</p>
<h3>How to Debate? and What are the basic skills to participate in Debate?</h3>
<p><h4>&nbsp1.Style</h4>
<div>&nbsp&nbspStyle is the manner in which you communicate your arguments.  This is the most basic part of debating to master.  Content and strategy are worth little unless you deliver your material in a confident and persuasive way.
</div>
<h4>&nbsp2.Speed</h4>
<div>&nbsp&nbspIt is vital to talk at a pace which is fast enough to sound intelligent and allow you time to say what you want, but slow enough to be easily understood. 
</div>
<h4>&nbsp3.Tone</h4>
<div>&nbsp&nbspVarying tone is what makes you sound interesting.  Listening to one tone for an entire presentation is boring.
</div>
<h4>&nbsp4.Volume</h4>
<div>&nbsp&nbspSpeaking quite loudly is sometimes a necessity, but it is by no means necessary to shout through every debate regardless of context.  There is absolutely no need speak any more loudly than the volume at which everyone in the room can comfortably hear you.  Shouting does not win debates.  Speaking too quietly is clearly disastrous since no one will be able to hear you.
 </div>
<h4>&nbsp5.Clarity</h4>
<div>&nbsp&nbspThe ability to concisely and clearly express complex issues is what debating is all about.  The main reason people begin to sound unclear is usually because they lose the “stream of thought” which is keeping them going. It is also important to keep it simple. While long words may make you sound clever, they may also make you incomprehensible. 
</div>
<h4>&nbsp6.Use of notes and eye contact</h4>
<div>&nbsp&nbspNotes are essential, but they must be brief and well organized to be effective.  There is absolutely no point in trying to speak without notes. Of course, notes should never become obtrusive and damage your contact with the audience, nor should they ever be read from verbatim.  Most people sketch out the main headings of their speech, with brief notes under each. When writing notes for rebuttal during the debate, it is usually better to use a separate sheet of paper so you can take down the details of what the other speakers have said and then transfer a rough outline onto the notes you will actually be using. 
Eye contact with the audience is very important, but keep shifting your gaze. No one likes to be stared at. 
</div> 
<h4>&nbsp7.Content</h4>
<div>&nbsp&nbspContent is what you actually say in the debate. The arguments used to develop your own side’s case and rebut the opposite side’s. The information on content provided below is a general overview of what will be expected when you debate. The final logistics of how long you will be debating, how many people will be in your group, and how the debate will unfold (ie: which team speaks first etc.), will all be decided by your tutorial leader.
</div>
<h4>&nbsp8.Case (argument): the whole</h4>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIntroduction : The case your group is making must be outlined in the introduction.  This involves stating your main arguments and explaining the general thrust of your case.  This must be done briefly since the most important thing is to get on and actually argue it. It is also a good idea to indicate the aspects of the subject to be discussed by each of the team members.
</div><div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspConclusion : At the end, once everyone has spoken, it is useful to briefly summarize what your group has said and why.
 </div>
<h4>&nbsp9.Case (argument): the parts</h4>
<div>&nbsp&nbspHaving outlined the whole of your argument, you must then begin to build a case (the parts).  The best way to do this is to divide your case into between two and four arguments (or divide your case based on the number of people in your group).  You must justify your arguments with basic logic, worked examples, statistics, and quotes.  Debating is all about the strategy of “proof”. Proof, or evidence, supporting your assertion is what makes it an argument. There are a number of ways of dividing up cases according to groups of arguments (eg political/economic/social or moral/practical or international/regional etc.) or just according to individual arguments if you can’t group any together.  Under each of these basic headings you should then explain the reasoning behind the argument and justify it using the methods outlined above.  It is usually best to put the most important arguments first.  Here is an example of a case outline:
</div> <div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  “The media exert more influence over what people think than the government does.  This is true for three reasons.  Firstly, most people base their votes on what they see and hear in the media. Secondly, the media can set the political agenda between elections by deciding what issues to report and in how much detail.  Thirdly, the media have successfully demonized politicians over the last ten years so that now people are more likely to believe journalists than politicians.”  
</div><div> &nbsp&nbsp&nbspAll of the arguments in this case outline are debatable (almost immediately you can see the counter-arguments), but they give the case a wide range which cover all kinds of issues.  The trick is not to come up with a watertight case, but a well argued one.  Think: “Can I argue that?”
</div>
<h4>&nbsp10.Rebuttal : the parts</h4>
<div>&nbsp&nbspArguments can be factually, morally or logically flawed. They may be misinterpretations or they may also be unimportant or irrelevant.  A team may also contradict one another or fail to complete the tasks they set themselves.  These are the basics of rebuttal and almost every argument can be found wanting in at least one of these respects.  Here are a few examples:
</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1)  “Compulsory euthanasia at age 70 would save the country money in pensions and healthcare.”  This is true, but is morally flawed.
</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2)  “Banning cigarette product placement in films will cause more young people to smoke because it will make smoking more mysterious and taboo.”  This is logically flawed, the ban would be more likely to stop the steady stream of images which make smoking seem attractive and glamorous and actually reduce the number of young people smoking.
</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3)   “My partner will then look at the economic issues...”  “Blah..blah..blah...(5 minutes later and still no mention of the economic issues)”  This is a clear failure to explain a major part of the case and attention should be drawn to it.  Even better is when a speaker starts with, “to win this debate there are three things I must do…”.  If the speaker fails to do any of those things you can then hang her or him by the noose by repeating their exact words – by his or her own admission he or she cannot have won the debate.
</div>
<h4>&nbsp11.Rebuttal : the whole:</h4>
<div>&nbsp&nbspIt is very important to have a good perspective of the debate and to identify what the key arguments are.  It isn’t enough to rebut a few random arguments here and there.  Of course the techniques used above are invaluable but they must be used appropriately.  There are a number of things you should do to systematically break down a team’s case: 
</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1)  Ask yourself how the other side have approached the case. Is their methodology flawed?
</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2)  Consider what tasks the other side set themselves (if any) and whether they have in fact addressed these. 
</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3)  Consider what the general emphasis of the case is and what assumptions it makes. Try to refute these. 
</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4)  Take the main arguments and do the same thing.  It is not worth repeating a point of rebuttal that has been used by someone else already, but you can refer to it to show that the argument has not stood up.  It is not necessary to correct every example used.  You won’t have time and your aim is to show the other side’s case to be flawed in the key areas
</div>
<h1>Types of Debate:</h1>
<p><div>There are 3 different types of debate.</div></p>
<h3>1.	Policy Debate: </h3>
<p><div>In this type of debate, you have teams of The topic for this type will consist of a current national question, and will be debated through constructive argument, cross examination, and refutation. Each team will argue both sides of the topic.</div></p>
<h3>2.	Lincoln Douglas: </h3>
<p><div>This is a very popular type of debate, with one person per team. The focus of Lincoln Douglas is values.  A Lincoln Douglas debater will develop argumentation skills such as value analysis, sound and ethical uses of persuasion, and how to clearly communicate to an audience.  Several topics are covered throughout the year.</div></p>
<h3>3.	Public Forum: </h3>
<p><div>This type of debate is known as the "audience friendly debate." The topics consist of controversial issues, such as those found in newspaper articles.  Public forum debaters will learn and use skills such as argumentation, cross-examination, and refutation.  Each month a new topic will be debated.</div></p>

<h2>Why is Debate important?</h2>
<p><div>Now a days debate become an important topic of discussion. It is important because it develops skills and knowledge. It helps the students  to become a confident and bold person. And it will help the students to develop a political identity or own identity like a debater. It also helps the students to develop a sense of ownership of the world and a sense of empowerment, as they will know specific global and domestic issues, and the ways in which the government can solve our generation’s problems. It will help them to boost their confidence and will make them bold enough to speak in any situation without any hesitation.</div></p>
<p><div>Debate is an indispensible characteristic of an individual that makes him put forward his perspective in analysing a situation of social cause whether be it in favour or against. Taking students into consideration it helps them to develop confidence within, makes them an extrovert and awares them of the burning issues of the country. Debate is all in vain if it's alpha and the omega are not apt with relavant conclusion revolving around the commonly known facts related to the topic.
</div><div>Debate is a social way of expression your point of view on a topic. And it teaches students how to accept different point of views of theirs and others in the same topic. They learn agree to disagree, may find a way to solve an issue, learn how to compromise with others.
</div></p>
<h2>Rules to participate in Debate:</h2>
<p><div>&nbsp&nbsp1. There are two teams, each consisting of two or three speakers.</div>

<div>&nbsp&nbsp2. Each team has two or three constructive speeches, and two to three rebuttal speeches. The affirmative gives the first constructive speech, and the rebuttals alternate: negative, affirmative, negative, affirmative. The affirmative has both the first and last speeches of the debate.
</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp3.When worded as a proposition of policy, the topic requires the affirmative to support some specified action by some particular individual or group. The affirmative has the right to make any reasonable definition of each of the terms of the proposition. If the negative challenges the reasonableness of a definition by the affirmative, the judge must accept the definition of the team that shows better grounds for its interpretation of the term.
</div><div>&nbsp&nbsp4. The affirmative must advocate everything required by the topic itself. No revision of position of a team is permitted during the debate.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp5. He who asserts must prove. In order to establish an assertion, the team must support it with enough evidence and logic to convince an intelligent but previously uninformed person that it is more reasonable to believe the assertion than to disbelieve it. Facts must be accurate. Visual materials are permissible, and once introduced, they become available for the opponents' use if desired.
</div><div>&nbsp&nbsp6. In the questioning period, the questioner may ask any fair, clear question that has a direct bearing on the debate. The questioner may use the period to build up any part of his own case, to tear down any part of his opposition's case, or to ascertain facts, such as the opposition's position on a certain issue, that can be used later in the debate. The questioner must confine himself to questions and not make statements, comments, or ask rhetorical questions.
</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp7. Each speaker is questioned as soon as he concludes his constructive speech. The witness must answer the questions without consulting his colleagues.</div>

<div>&nbsp&nbsp8. No new constructive arguments may be introduced in the rebuttal period. The affirmative must, if possible, reply to the major negative arguments before the last rebuttal.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp9. The judge must base his decision entirely on the material presented, without regard for other material which he may happen to possess.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp10. Any gains made outside of the established procedure are disallowed.</div>
</p>
<h2>Tips and Tricks to participate in Debate:</h2>
<p><div>1. Think as if you were your judge, not yourself.  Remember, the only person whose opinion matters at the end of the round is the judge’s, not yours!  A common mistake everyone in public speaking makes is assuming that because you understand the argument that your audience does as well.  Take into account the judge’s debate experience before using a lot of debate lingo, and make sure you look up at your judge while making a key point.  This will both reinforce your argument because of the eye contact you will make, and it will allow you to look for signals from the judge (ie, shaking her head) that she understands you.</p>
</div>
<p><div>2. Always think comparatively.  Every argument that you make, at the end of the round, will be compared against something the other team said.  If you’re affirmative, for example, you should always be thinking in the mindset of “how does my plan compare to the status quo?” [i.e., doing nothing, what the negative frequently advocates].  For both sides, the most effective way to do this is through impact calculus.  You should always be weighing the relative importance of arguments, especially ultimate impact claims against each other.  A nuclear attack by terrorists because of the collapse of the Pakistani state is undoubtedly extremely bad, but is the spread of nuclear weapons to many more states even worse?  If you make comparative claims about why your arguments matter more than the other teams,  you can win the debate round even if the other team wins their arguments! A good flow will help you keep track of the arguments. Here is a sample flow chart.</p>
</div>
<p><div>3. Always act like you’re winning, even if you’re not.  Composure, poise, ethos, whatever you want to call it is an essential skill in public speaking and in life in general.  This does not mean be arrogant!  Rather, it means that you should always display confidence in the arguments that your team is making.  Think about it this way – if the judge doesn’t think you believe in your own arguments, why should he be inclined believe them himself?</p>
</div>
<p><div>4. Refer to your evidence whenever possible.  Even though your own arguments are the most important, far too many debaters discount the importance of referring to evidence, especially that read in the early speeches.  The 1AC isn’t just a way to fill up 8 minutes, it contains valuable warrants by qualified authors that supports the arguments that you will be making in the 2AR.  If you are making a point that one of your authors makes in one of your cards, saying so will give your argument credence over that of your opponents.  If you’re not planning to refer to a piece of evidence in a later speech, why would you be reading it in the first place.</p>
</div>
<p><div>5. Remember that debate is a team activity.  Even if you are stronger than your partner, you shouldn’t take over their speech or answer all of their questions in cross-examination.  When that happens, your judge is more inclined to give both of the members lower speaker points, and one debater doesn’t learn the skills necessary to get better.  Instead, make sure that you and your partner are going over arguments together so that you can teach each other the best arguments to make.</p>
