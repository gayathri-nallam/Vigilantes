<h2>WHAT IS MICROPHONE </h2>
 <p>
 A microphone, colloquially named mic or mike ,[ is a device – a transducer – that converts sound into an electrical signal. Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones, hearing aids, public address systems for concert halls and public events, motion picture production, live and recorded audio engineering, sound recording, two-way radios, megaphones, radio and television broadcasting, and in computers for recording voice, speech recognition, VoIP, and for non-acoustic purposes such as ultrasonic sensors or knock sensors.
 </p>
 <p>
 Several types of microphone are in use, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure variations of a sound wave to an electrical signal. The most common are the dynamic microphone, which uses a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field; the condenser microphone, which uses the vibrating diaphragm as a capacitor plate; and the piezoelectric microphone, which uses a crystal of piezoelectric material. Microphones typically need to be connected to a preamplifier before the signal can be recorded or reproduced.

  <h2>How to Speak with a Microphone</h2>
  <p>
  How do you use a microphone when giving a speech? Should you use a microphone? These are two questions I’m frequently asked during workshops or coaching sessions.
  </p>
  <p>
  Too often, I see people stand up at conferences and shout, “You can all hear me, right?” And when no one has the nerve to say “no,” the speaker goes on to shout their speech.  Or, they take the microphone and hold it down by their belly button, where it can’t pick up any sound. Both instances show disrespect for your audience; if your audience can’t hear you, they can’t be moved to action.
  </p>
  <p>
  I’ve used microphones both for speaking and singing and I know that using a microphone is a powerful way to fill the room with your message and get your voice heard. Using it correctly can make the difference between sounding like a professional and sounding like an amateur.
  </p>
  <h2>“…if your audience can’t hear you, you can’t move them to take action.”</h2>
  <p>
  Here are my tips for using a microphone effectively.
  </p>
  <h3>1.	Always be willing to use a microphone. </h3>
  <p>
  <div>In any audience, you will have varying hearing levels and English levels; don’t make it hard for people to listen to you. It’s healthier for your voice – and more pleasant for your audience’s ears – if you don’t have to yell.</div>
  	If you are making comments during a conference, stand up and use a mic. It ensures that everyone can hear you and – as a result – increases your credibility and authority.
</p>
<h3> 2.	Determine in advance if you will or will not need a microphone. </h3>
<p>  <div>  You’ll want to use a mic for one of two reasons: the audience is larger than 20 people, or the event will be recorded. </div></p>
<h3>3.	Decide which type of microphone to use. </h3>
<p>  <div>  At a conference, you can usually choose between a handheld or a hands-free mic. Whenever possible, I choose a hands-free microphone: a lavalier or lapel mic, an earset mic, etc. That way, it doesn’t disrupt my natural hand gestures.</div>
	Avoid using the lectern mic, because it locks you to the lectern and prevents you from walking around and engaging the audience. If you must use the lectern mic, adjust the mic height in advance.

</p>
<h3> 4.	Check the battery and volume in advance. </h3>
<p> There might not be a sound technician available to help you; always check the battery and volume level before you walk on stage. You can say something like, “Testing, testing” or “Check 1. Check 2.” instead of “Hey, is this thing on?”
</p>
<h3>5.	Where to put a lapel mic: </h3>
<p>   If you’re wearing a suit, you can clip the lapel mic to your lapel (hence the name), on your button-down shirt, or on your tie about 8-12 inches from your face; clip the transmitter on the back of your belt loop. Ladies, if you’re wearing a dress and don’t have a belt loop, you might clip the receiver on the top back of your dress; it’s a little uncomfortable but you will get used to it. Wherever you put the mic, ensure it isn’t covered by hair or clothing as that affects the sound quality.
</p>
<h3>6.	Cough AWAY from the mic.  </h3>
<p> It happens: sometimes we have to cough or sneeze on stage. Remember to turn away from the mic, otherwise the entire room will resonate with your booming sneeze.
</p>
<h3> 7.	For a hand-held microphone, hold the mic about 6-8 inches from your face, just under your mouth. </h3>
<p> When your head moves, move your hand with it so that your mic follows your mouth. Use your free hand to make hand gestures.</p>
<h3> 8.	Speak with a strong, clearvoice.</h3>
<p>   Don’t try to yell and don’t assume that it’s OK to whisper. The microphone amplifies the voice itself; make sure it’s amplifying a strong, confident voice. 
 </p>
<h3> 9.	Relax if the mic doesn’t work.</h3>
<p>  Sometimes there will be a problem with the sound. Relax and don’t let it overwhelm you. I was once in the middle of a presentation on stage using a lapel mic when the sound technician walked up, gave me a handheld microphone, and proceeded to stand behind me fiddling with the transmitter on my belt. I used humor to show the audience I was relaxed, saying “I will continue talking and pretend that there isn’t someone behind me right now playing with my belt.” The more relaxed you are, the more relaxed the audience will be.
</p>
<h3> 10.	Assume the mic is always on! </h3>
<p>  <div> 1.	Sometimes the sound technician will tell you that they have turned off the mic. Regardless, I never, ever, go into the restroom with a mic on me. While the odds are low that something will happen, the potential for embarrassment is high.</div>
1.	Rather than be intimidated, look at the mic as an opportunity to amplify your message. Remind yourself why your speech subject is important to you, and use that energy and enthusiasm to fuel your passion when speaking. The mic is there to make your job easier.</p>


<h2> Hints for Speaking into a Microphone </h2>

<p>Using a microphone is straightforward. Use the same full voice you would normally use to be heard in conversation and you sound good. Don’t try to be anyone else by putting on a special microphone voice. Put feeling and interest into your voice to engage people as you would without a mike.</p>

<p>Here are just a few practical tips you need to remember:</p>
<p>1.Know your mike. Microphones come in many different types and styles, including:</p>
		<div>o	Handheld. With this mike, keep the ball of the microphone below your mouth a few centimeters from your face and pointed toward your nose so that the air travels over the mike and not directly into it. Alternatively, touch the ball to your chin and keep it there.</div>
		<div>o	Lavaliere mike. This is a mike that clips to your lapel or collar, and usually has a battery pack that you attach to your waistband. Speak normally as if speaking to a small group without a mike. The mike allows you to move about freely, but try not to turn your head too much. If you need to constantly turn to look at a screen, clip the mike to that side of your lapel.</div>
		<div>o	Podium mike. Point the microphone at your mouth about two hand widths away, and speak across the mike, not into it. Don’t turn right away from the mike. If you have to adjust the mike, bend the neck without touching the mike itself to avoid nasty feedback.</div>
<p>2.Find the on off button before you start! Find the on, off, standby and mute buttons before your speech so that you aren’t caught in confusion in front of your audience. Switch to the appropriate mode before and after you speak. Speakers have occasionally been highly embarrassed by making an intimate comment off the cuff with the mike still on, and being heard by everyone present!</p>
<p>3.Do a sound check. Always find an opportunity to try your microphone before you speak, whether a technician is in charge of the sound system or not. Every venue and system is different, so get someone to check the sound with you and evaluate volume and quality from different parts of the room.</p>
<p>4.Test just before speaking. Don’t blow into the mike or hit the top which makes an unpleasant sound for your audience. Instead, gently tap the side just under the mouthpiece or speak your first words listening for amplification. Wireless mikes take a second to kick in after being switched on, so count to 3 before you speak.</p>
<p>5.Wear the right clothes. Wear something with a lapel or tie for the lavaliere mike for easy clipping. A front-opening jacket or a blouse is also fine. Beware of clothes that rustle, and make sure that buttons and jewellery are out of the way to avoid amplifying their sounds. Have a belt or waistband to clip the battery pack to, or a pocket to slip it into.</p>
<p>6.Keep your distance. Don’t get too close to the microphone, which distorts your voice. The microphone is designed to capture a voice that flows over or across it, not into it. If you get too close, the mike amplifies every breath, click, pop and hiss.
