<h1><center>PUBLIC SPEAKING</center></h1>
<p><div>-Public speaking is the process or act of performing a speech to a live audience. Public speaking is commonly understood as formal, face to face, speaking of a single person to a group of listeners. </div>
<div> -Public speaking is the art of using words to share information with an audience. It includes speaking to audiences of any size, from a handful of seminar participants to millions of people watching on television.</p></div>
<h3>Mastering public speaking requires first differentiating between four of the primary types of public speaking: ceremonial, demonstrative, informative and persuasive.</h3>
<p>  <div>&nbsp &nbsp1.	Ceremonial Speaking. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp2.	Demonstrative Speaking. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp3.	Informative Speaking. </div>
<div>&nbsp &nbsp4.	Persuasive Speaking.</div>

</p>
<h3>1.Ceremonial Speaking</h3>
<div><p> &nbsp &nbsp Most people will give some sort of ceremonial speech during their lifetime. These speeches mark special occasions. They are common at weddings, graduations and funerals -- as well as large birthday celebrations and office holiday parties. Ceremonial speaking typically involves a toast and is personal with an intimate emotional connection to people hearing it.</p></div>
<h3>2.Demonstrative Speaking</h3>
<div><p>&nbsp &nbsp Science demonstrations and role playing are types of demonstrative speaking. This type of public speaking requires being able to speak clearly and concisely to describe actions and to perform those actions while speaking. A demonstrative speaker may explain the process behind generating power while cycling to power a toaster, for example. The idea behind demonstrative speaking is that the audience members leave with the knowledge about how to do something.</p></div>
<h3>3.Informative Speaking</h3>
<div><p>&nbsp &nbsp With informative speaking, the speaker is trying simply to explain a concept to the audience members. College lecture courses involve informative speaking as do industry conferences and public officials sharing vital information. In this type of speaking, the information is what is important. The speaker is not trying to get others to agree with him or to show them how to do something for themselves. Rather he is disseminating vital information.</p></div>
<h3>4.Persuasive Speaking</h3>
<div><p>&nbsp &nbspPersuasive speaking tends to be the glitzy. Politicians, lawyers and clergy members use persuasive speaking. This type of speaking requires practicing voice inflections and nuances of language that will convince the audience members of a certain viewpoint. The persuasive speaker has a stake in the outcome of the speech. Politicians, for instance, may want votes or a groundswell of support for a pet project, while lawyers are trying to convince a jury of their position -- and clergy members are trying to win others over to their faith. The persuasive speaker uses emotional appeals and strong language in speeches.</p></div>

<h2>IMPORTANT FEATURES:</h2>
<h3>&nbsp Voice Control</h3>
<p> <div>&nbsp &nbspYour voice is the most important tool you will use as a public speaker. One simple way to improve your voice is by learning to breathe fully and deeply from your diaphragm. </div>
<div>Diaphragmatic breathing, or belly breathing, is essential for accessing your most powerful voice. It is the technique professional singers use to make their voices sound fabulous. It enables them to hold notes long after most people would be out of breath.</div>
</p>
<h3>&nbsp Body Language</h3>
<p> <div>&nbsp &nbsp Simply put, body language is your body's way of communicating without using words. It's the combination of facial expressions, gestures, and movements that convey what's going on in your mind. Practice strong, confident body language to fuel your presentation:</div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp1.	Stand up straight. If you're physically capable of standing up straight, then make sure you stand tall and straight during your presentation.</div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp2.Assume the [power] position. If you're feeling stressed before your presentation, take a moment to stand in a powerful position. Doing this for just a few minutes will raise your testosterone and increase your self-confidence while reducing stress, anxiety, and cortisol.1 One of the most popular power poses is the "superhero" pose: Put your hands on your hips, keep your chin up, and your chest out. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp3.	Be facially expressive. Your facial expressions should match the message you are delivering. If you're giving an upbeat speech, try to have a relaxed and joyful look on your face. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp4.	Plant your feet. Shifting your weight from side to side can lull your audience into a semi-hypnotic state (also known as sleep). Stand tall and firm. </div>
<div> &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp If you feel that your stage presence is lacking, view clips of speakers you admire. Aim to imitate parts of their style that you feel could work for you. Then, "fake it until you make it." In other words, act confident until you feel confident.</div>
</p>
<h3>&nbsp Delivery</h3>
<p> <div>&nbsp &nbsp When it comes to public speaking, delivery is everything. Even if you have a great voice and good body language, your message will get lost if the audience can't easily follow what you say. Below are some tips for developing good delivery skills: </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp1.	Speak slowly, but not too slowly. Talk too fast and your audience will have a hard time understanding you. Talk too slowly and you risk putting them to sleep. When it comes to public speaking, talking at a conversational pace is your safest.  </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp2.	Pause between ideas. Great public speakers often pause for two to three seconds or even longer. A well-placed pause gives the audience time to digest what you are saying. It also makes you sound more confident and in control. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp3.	Avoid filler words. Words such as "um," "ah," "you know," and "like" diminish your credibility and distract from your message. Instead, replace these filler words with pauses. </div>
<div>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp4.	Carefully articulate and pronounce your words. A mumbling public speaker is hard to understand.</div>
</p>
<h3>&nbspAudience Relations</h3>
<p> <div>&nbsp &nbsp Good public speakers are in tune with their audience. Public speaking is more than standing in front of a group and talking; you also need to engage your audience. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1.	Acknowledge your audience as soon as you take the stage. This helps to make you seem more like a "real" person and keeps a conversational tone. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp2.Grab their attention immediately. When you speak, you have about 60 seconds to capture your audience's attention and captivate them before they tune out.2 Use this time to ask a rhetorical thought-provoking question, tell a captivating story, or share a shocking statistic—anything that will keep them intrigued. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp3.Find a friendly face. There's bound to be friendly people in the audience. Find those people and pretend that you're speaking to only them. </div>
<div>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp4.Make eye contact. Regardless of how big your audience is, try to make eye contact with as many people as possible. It will make them feel like you are speaking directly to them.</div>
</p>
<h2>TOP Public Speaking Skills:</h2>
<p> <div>&nbsp &nbsp 1.&nbspResearch a topic : Good speakers stick to what they know. Great speakers research what they need to convey their messaging. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 2.&nbsp	Focus : Help your audience grasp your message by focusing on your message. Stories, humour, or other “sidebars” should connect to the core idea. Anything that doesn’t needs to be edited out. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 3.&nbsp	Organize ideas logically :A well-organized presentation can be absorbed with minimal mental strain. Bridging is key. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 4.&nbsp	Employ quotations, facts, and statistics : Don’t include these for the sake of including them, but do use them appropriately to complement your ideas. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 5.&nbsp	Master metaphors : Metaphors enhance the understandability of the message in a way that direct language often cannot. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 6.&nbsp	Tell a story : Everyone loves a story. Points wrapped up in a story are more memorable, too! </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 7.&nbsp	Start strong and close stronger : The body of your presentation should be strong too, but your audience will remember your first and last words (if, indeed, they remember anything at all). </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 8.&nbsp	Incorporate humour : Knowing when to use humour is essential. So is developing the comedic timing to deliver it with greatest effect. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 9.&nbsp	Vary vocal pace, tone, and volume :A monotone voice is like fingernails on the chalkboard. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 10.&nbsp	Punctuate words with gestures : Gestures should complement your words in harmony. Tell them how big the fish was, and show them with your arms. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 11.&nbsp	Utilize 3-dimensional space : Chaining yourself to the lectern limits the energy and passion you can exhibit. Lose the notes, and lose the chain. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 12.&nbsp	Complement words with visual aids : Visual aids should aid the message; they should not be the message.  </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 13.&nbsp	Analyze your audience : Deliver the message they want (or need) to hear. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 14.&nbsp	Connect with the audience : Eye contact is only the first step. Aim to have the audience conclude “This speaker is just like me!” The sooner, the better. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 15.&nbsp	Interact with the audience : Ask questions (and care about the answers). Solicit volunteers. Make your presentation a dialogue. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 16.&nbsp	Conduct a Q&A session : Not every speaking opportunity affords a Q&A session, but understand how to lead one productively. Use the Q&A to solidify the impression that you are an expert, not (just) a speaker. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 17.&nbsp	Lead a discussion : Again, not every speaking opportunity affords time for a discussion, but know how to engage the audience productively. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 18.&nbsp	Obey time constraints : Maybe you have 2 minutes. Maybe you have 45. Either way, customize your presentation to fit the time allowed, and respect your audience by not going over time. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 19.&nbsp	Craft an introduction :Set the context and make sure the audience is ready to go, whether the introduction is for you or for someone else. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 20.&nbsp	Exhibit confidence and poise : These qualities are sometimes difficult for a speaker to attain, but easy for an audience to sense. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 21.&nbsp	Handle unexpected issues smoothly : Maybe the lights will go out. Maybe the projector is dead. Have a plan to handle every situation. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 22.&nbsp	Be coherent when speaking off the cuff : Impromptu speaking (before, after, or during a presentation) leaves a lasting impression too. Doing it well tells the audience that you are personable, and that you are an expert who knows their stuff beyond the slides and prepared speech. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 23.&nbsp	Seek and utilize feedback : Understand that no presentation or presenter (yes, even you!) is perfect. Aim for continuous improvement, and understand that the best way to improve is to solicit candid feedback from as many people as you can. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 24.&nbsp	Listen critically and analyze other speakers : Study the strengths and weakness of other speakers. </div>
 <div>&nbsp &nbsp 25.&nbsp	Act and speak ethically : Since public speaking fears are so common, realize the tremendous power of influence that you hold. Use this power responsibly. </div>

<h2>FEW THINGS TO REMEMBER:</h2><br>
<h3>&nbsp1. &nbspNERVOUSNESS IS NORMAL. PRACTICE AND PREPARE!</h3>
<div><p>&nbsp &nbsp All people feel some physiological reactions like pounding hearts and trembling hands. Do not associate these feelings with the sense that you will perform poorly or make a fool of yourself. Some nerves are good. The adrenaline rush that makes you sweat also makes you more alert and ready to give your best performance.
The best way to overcome anxiety is to prepare, prepare, and prepare some more. Take the time to go over your notes several times. Once you have become comfortable with the material, practice—a lot. Videotape yourself, or get a friend to critique your performance.
</div></p>
<h3>&nbsp2.&nbsp KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE. YOUR SPEECH IS ABOUT THEM, NOT YOU.</h3>
<div><p>&nbsp&nbspBefore you begin to craft your message, consider who the message is intended for. Learn as much about your listeners as you can. This will help you determine your choice of words, level of information, organization pattern, and motivational statement.</p></div>
<h3>&nbsp3.&nbsp ORGANIZE YOUR MATERIAL IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE MANNER TO ATTAIN YOUR PURPOSE.</h3>
<div><p>&nbsp&nbspCreate the framework for your speech. Write down the topic, general purpose, specific purpose, central idea, and main points. Make sure to grab the audience’s attention in the first 30 seconds.</p></div>
<h3>&nbsp4.&nbsp WATCH FOR FEEDBACK AND ADAPT TO IT.</h3>
<div><p>&nbsp&nbspKeep the focus on the audience. Gauge their reactions, adjust your message, and stay flexible. Delivering a canned speech will guarantee that you lose the attention of or confuse even the most devoted listeners.</p></div>
<h3>&nbsp5.&nbsp LET YOUR PERSONALITY COME THROUGH.</h3>
<div><p>&nbsp&nbspBe yourself, don’t become a talking head—in any type of communication. You will establish better credibility if your personality shines through, and your audience will trust what you have to say if they can see you as a real person.</p></div>
<h3>&nbsp6.&nbsp USE HUMOR, TELL STORIES, AND USE EFFECTIVE LANGUAGE</h3>
<div><p>&nbsp &nbspInject a funny anecdote in your presentation, and you will certainly grab your audience’s attention. Audiences generally like a personal touch in a speech. A story can provide that.</p></div>
<h3>&nbsp7.&nbsp DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. WORK FROM AN OUTLINE.</h3>
<div><p>&nbsp &nbspReading from a script or slide fractures the interpersonal connection. By maintaining eye contact with the audience, you keep the focus on yourself and your message. A brief outline can serve to jog your memory and keep you on task.</p></div>
<h3>&nbsp8.&nbsp USE YOUR VOICE AND HANDS EFFECTIVELY. OMIT NERVOUS GESTURES.</h3>
<div><p>&nbsp &nbspNonverbal communication carries most of the message. Good delivery does not call attention to itself, but instead conveys the speaker’s ideas clearly and without distraction.</p></div>
<h3>&nbsp9.&nbsp GRAB ATTENTION AT THE BEGINNING, AND CLOSE WITH A DYNAMIC END.</h3>
<div><p>&nbsp&nbspDo you enjoy hearing a speech start with “Today I’m going to talk to you about X”? Most people don’t. Instead, use a startling statistic, an interesting anecdote, or concise quotation. Conclude your speech with a summary and a strong statement that your audience is sure to remember.</p></div>
<h3>&nbsp10.&nbsp USE AUDIOVISUAL AIDS WISELY.</h3>
<div><p>&nbsp&nbspToo many can break the direct connection to the audience, so use them sparingly. They should enhance or clarify your content, or capture and maintain your audience’s attention.</p></div>
