<h1><center>GROUP DISCUSSION</center></h1>
<h3>Definition of Group Discussion: </h3>
<p><div> Group Discussion is a modern method of assessing students  personality. </div>
<div>&nbsp &nbspa.&nbsp	It is both a technique and an art and a comprehensive tool to judge the worthiness of the student and his appropriateness for the job.</div>
<div>&nbsp &nbspb.&nbsp	In group discussion, no single person imposes his or her own opinion on everyone else.</div>
<div>&nbsp &nbspc.&nbsp	It is essentially a sharing of experience, and not doing or thinking what someone else has decided beforehand that the group must of or think.</div>
<div>&nbsp &nbspd.&nbsp	When a subject is being discussed in a group and a member wants to say something about it, he has to understand clearly what he is going to say and he has to have a good idea of what he is putting forward.</div>
<div>&nbsp &nbspe.&nbsp	Other people may not agree with him and they may have their ides and possibly very good idea.</div>
</p>
<h3>Purpose of Group Discussions:</h3>
<p><div>Group discussions may serve various purposes. Some of them are:</div>
<div>&nbsp(i)  To reach a solution on an issue of concern</div>
<div>&nbsp(ii)  To generate new ideas or new approaches to solving a problem</div>
<div>&nbsp(iii)  For selecting candidates after the written test for employment or for admission to educational institutes</div>
<div>&nbsp(iv) To provide us with an avenue to train ourselves in various interpersonal skills</div>
</p>
<h3>Why GD is important?</h3>
<p><div>It helps evaluate whether a candidate is the right fit for the organisation.</div>
<div>It helps assess how a participant performs under different situations in a group.</div>
<div>It helps to judge how one conceptualizes and manoeuvres his ideas through the discussion.</div>
<div>It helps in analysing the candidate’s attitude towards fellow members through one’s communication and interpersonal skills, listening ability, humility and tolerance to others ideas.</div>
<div>It helps in shedding light on candidate’s leadership and managerial skills, problem solving aptitude, creative thinking and knowledge on diverse topics.</div>
<div>Since, team work is an essential element of business management and corporate work sphere, a person’s ability to perform well in a GD is very critical for a successful career. A GD helps to achieve group goals as well as individual goals. The examiner can evaluate both the personality traits and group skills of candidates participating in a G.D. It is basically a situation test wherein a sample of a candidate’s group worthiness and potential as a worker comes out quite explicitly.</div>
</p>
<h3>What are the various types of Group Discussions?</h3>
<p><div>&nbspMost Group Discussions can be divided into 3 kinds:</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbspA) Topical Group Discussions, which are based on current affairs or ‘static’ matters : for example, a GD on the topic of the recent demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes would be the former, whereas a GD on whether India should adopt a presidential model of democracy would be the latter, as it has no limitation of a time frame.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbspB) Case-studies, which present the group with a complex business situation that requires a decision to be made. Such cases usually have multiple problems embedded in the given situation, and both the individual participants and the group are required to analyse the situation, identify the problems, and suggest a way out.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbspC) Abstract Group Discussions, which are called so because they offer us no definite framework of the topic, and hence no definite direction to take in the discussion. Instead, the participants are required to interpret the topic in their own ways and demonstrate innovative thinking in doing so. Such topics could be single-worded, such as ‘Blue’, or a short cryptic sentence, or even an image.</div>
<div>Contrary to popular perception, no one kind of GD is necessarily easier or more difficult than any other, as the quality of response in any case depends largely on the preparation of the individual and the way they generally think.</div>
</p>
<h3>What is the evaluation criteria in a Group Discussion?</h3>
<p><div>The evaluation of participants happens in two broad perspective: </div>
<div>&nbsp Individual qualities and group skills.</div>
<div>&nbspIndividual qualities refer to the competencies that you may demonstrate in or outside the context of a group. They include the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbspA) Content: What you say during the discussion is looked into from two perspectives – relevance and comprehensiveness. It is possible that a participant has talked a great deal in a GD, but he or she may have deviated from the topic significantly, in which case the content is deemed largely irrelevant without the possibility of further evaluation. If the content has been relevant to the topic, the panel examines whether your treatment of the topic is superficial or in-depth, distinction we shall discuss in detail in the next few posts.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbspB) Analytical skills: The panel is of course interested in your facts, but they also like to see whether or not you can explore the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ of the subject matter. This is put to the sternest test in a case-study topic.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbspC) Reasoning skills: The panel looks at how you support your standpoints, and how you respond to those of the others, how effectively you can ‘strengthen or weaken’ an argument, how logical you are in your overall approach to the topic.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbspD) Organisation skills: You may have the facts, the supports, the explanations, but are you able to present them in the right order so as to maximise the impact of your good content? The panel wants to examine this.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbspE) Communication skills: You may have exhibited all the skills stated above, but can you get your point across to someone in a simple (not simplistic) language they understand, with relevant illustrations they can identify with?</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbspF) Creativity: Are you able to bring to the table a novel perspective on the topic? Can you look at a problem differently from ten other participants and suggest a path-breaking solution? Can you interpret an abstract topic in ways the others cannot? If yes, the panel looks at you as someone with one of the rarest of human qualities.</div>
   
<div>You may have observed that the above skills and qualities can also be directly applied in the evaluation of the WAT response.</div>
<div>On the other hand, the group skills refer to those skills which can only be evaluated in the context of a group. They include the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbspA) Listening skill: The panel constantly observes whether or not every participant is listening to the discussion. In my experience, most participants are concerned only with speaking, and feel that they are done with the job as soon as they have spoken, which is contrary to the spirit of a discussion. There are many ways a panel may infer that a participant is a poor listener, such as a lack of eye contact with the group, or a poor summary at the end. It is one of the rarest skills, and a must for a would-be manager.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbspB) Leadership quality: In highly-charged discussions, one or two participants usually play the role of the anchor, in that they define the topic appropriately, offer the initial analysis of the keywords of the topic, and also try to hold the group together in pursuit of a common goal. Such individuals could demonstrate effective leadership, and score some extra points. However, one cannot score anything extra simply because one spoke first in the group, or was the loudest.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbspC) Body language: While assessing the body language, the panel primarily looks at eye contact and hand movements. The speaker must maintain a consistent eye contact with the entire group as he or she speaks, and the listeners must reciprocate. If the either doesn’t happen, you allow the panel to infer whatever they wish to – from a lack of confidence to a lack of interest in the GD to the lack of concern for others. All very detrimental to the final score. Hand movements are to your speech what punctuation is to your writing. If used wisely they beautifully enhance the effect of your words; if used unwisely they attract unnecessary attention and distract the listener from your words. I recommend that you simply ‘free’ your hands. Do not engage them with something pointless such as playing with the pen, or tapping on the desk, or running through your hair (common among female participants). The body has an intelligence of its own. Just leave your hands alone and focus on the topic. The hands will start moving naturally. Please remember that body language cannot be faked. A skilled observer will quickly see through such deception. Just focus on the task at hand and the body will obediently follow. The panel may also pay attention to your voice modulation. A monotonous pitch may reduce the impact of even the most powerful words unless you are a Tommy Lee Jones! Vary the pitch of your voice in order to create emphasis wherever needed.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbspD) Group behaviour: This is usually assessed in a broad distinction – assertive or aggressive. Avoid the latter no matter what. Assertiveness is a rational display of conviction of one’s thoughts, while aggressiveness is a display of domination through subtle intimidation. Assertiveness allows room for flexibility – which is a desired trait – while aggressiveness leads to irrational rigidity of viewpoint. Please remember that B-schools are looking for sensitive individuals, not skinhead bouncers.</div>
<div>Now that you know how you will be evaluated, focus on specific areas of improvement during your practice GD’s. Identify with the help of your trainer the strengths and weaknesses. Set clear goals for yourselves, and do not lose the sight of them during your practice.
</div></p>
<h2>Rules to participate in Group Discussion:</h2>
<h3>Rule 1: Prepare</h3>
<p><div>Work begins long before you sit for the group discussion. Your performance is as good as your preparation. Half the preparation is about knowledge. If you think you can wing it with aggression, you are mistaken. Find out the kind of topics that are given at the institution or company you are applying for.
Prepare well in time on as many topics as you can, not just the ones given in the past, but related ones too. You never know when the subject would be changed. Get into the habit of active reading. It’s different from passive reading. Passive reading is where you read merely to understand the subject. Active reading is where you not only understand the subject, but also begin to raise questions and voice your opinion – positive, negative or neutral about the subject. This is critical in the group discussion to counter or support others’ points of view.
The next part of rule 1 is to have mock group discussion, preferably with differing groups of friends. The point is to train your mind to think of any given topic’s pros and cons in a dynamic situation where you can’t predict the person’s response. More importantly, it is about looking at all the possible angles to the topic. This shows your logical mind, creativity and also your ability to think on your feet which comes with preparation.
</div></p>
<h3>Rule  2: Know the Participants</h3>
<p><div>Carry a notepad and pen to note down your discussion points as soon as the topic is given. Most people who attend GDs are as focused on their performance as they tend to be. Take a deep breath and when the team introduces itself, note down the participants’ names.
In the heat of the discussion, calling out the person’s name is a good way to get their attention. All of us respond instinctively when our name is called out, so use this technique. Not only does it get you their attention, it also shows your people skills and presence of mind.
</div></p>
<h3>Rule 3: Take Care of your Posture</h3>
<p><div>Your body posture reveals your state of mind. At the same time, it conditions you to a particular way of thinking. Don’t lean back or lean forward. Find the balance.
Let your body posture be of polite intensity so that you come across as a balanced individual with plenty of energy. This also shows empathy and respect to others when they speak and is an asset that brings you additional points.
</div></p>
<h3>Rule 4: Take Charge</h3>
<p><div>Take charge of the group discussion right in the beginning. It shows your leadership capability. Introduce the topic by setting the framework for the ensuing discussion and state your opening point before leaving it to the group. Further, when it comes to conclusions, many GDs fall through and participants don’t make good use of it although it brings points.
Conclude the discussion by summing up if you can. To do this, listen actively throughout the discussion and note down the key highlights – say, in columns of negative and positive points on your notepad or any other format that suits the discussion.
</div></p>
<h3>Rule 5: Retain Your Balance</h3>
<p><div>During the group discussion itself, give your logical counterpoint without aggression when there is a disagreement. You are not there to prove that your stand is right, but to show your maturity and logical thinking. When the discussion drags over a point, it is time for you to interject and turn the discussion in a new direction, either with a related point or with an opposite view.
Be to the point and intervene when another candidate is taking all the airtime. When they pause for breath, it is the right time to take your chance, state your point and then, pass the chance to someone who hasn’t had their say.
</div></p>
<h3>Rule 6: Follow your Domain</h3>
<p><div>Keep the domain in mind while projecting your image. Let’s suppose you are facing a group discussion for a sales function, you may have to take a more aggressive approach whereas a marketing function could veer towards the creative and the practical approach in assessment.
Group discussion is as much about your knowledge and point-of-view as about how you handle yourself and others. Do these right and you will have projected the right image.
</div></p>
<h2>Tips to participate in Group Discussion:</h2>
<p><div>While personal interview may be the more important technique for deciding the merits of a candidate, group discussion carries its own weight. You can make your GD performance better by using these tips.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp1. &nbspThe employer is looking for a natural leader who is also a balanced thinker. Leadership is by helping each team member achieve his full potential in solving the problem at hand. So, try to lead.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp2.&nbsp Observe the personality types present in the group. Greet the group cheerfully and decide the method you would like to follow to ensure equitable participation by all members. For example, you may have 20 minutes’ time and seven members in the group.</div>
<div>You may suggest that in the first round everyone should speak for two minutes and then throw the topic open for cross opinions.</div>
<div>You may suggest that the speaker should not be interrupted during his talk; the members should make their notes and express disagreement in their proper turn. To say so much requires a good deal of confidence, which is best attained through practice.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp3.&nbsp Always maintain a calm temper. If unjustly opposed, use polite expressions to restate your position.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp4.&nbsp If there are private mini-discussions between two or three members, suggest that the whole group should get the benefit of their views.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp5.&nbsp Generally, job selection GDs are impromptu (the topic is given on the spot). If so, quickly plan an ex tempore speech to fill the time that you may fairly be allotted by the group. Practice in ex tempore stage speaking helps in GD.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp6.&nbsp Be a good listener. (Refer to the chapter “Listening as a Tool of Communication.”) Do not talk when some other member is addressing the group, nor indulge in minor entertainment (e.g. fiddling with a pin). Cheer, appreciate, nod and in other ways be an active, dynamic listener.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp7.&nbsp See that the group arrives at a conclusion in the allotted time. Help the group to complete the task in time by active timekeeping.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp8. &nbspIf an idea superior to your idea is expressed by somebody with specialized knowledge, be ready to adopt it. Lee Iacocca, as American trade unions said, was one of the few adult Americans who could change their mind. However, take care to maintain your standing in the group in spite of conceding some ground to another.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp9.&nbsp If you find someone else emerging as a leader, you still can brighten your chances of selection by your healthy cooperation to the leader.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp10.&nbsp Part with the group as you started, with a cheerful smile. Make a proper farewell.</div>
